       "0                                     Always trouble-prone, the life of teenager Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) gets a lot more complicated when he learns he's the son of the Greek god Poseidon. At a training ground for the children of deities, Percy learns to harness his divine powers and prepare for the adventure of a lifetime: he must prevent a feud among the Olympians from erupting into a devastating war on Earth, and rescue his mother from the clutches of Hades, god of the underworld.   \n",
       "1     Kate (Catherine Keener) and her husband Alex (Oliver Platt) are wealthy New Yorkers who prowl estate sales and make a tidy profit reselling items they bought cheaply. They buy the apartment next door and plan to remodel just as soon as its current occupant, a cranky old woman, dies. Kate is troubled by the way she and her husband earn a living, and tries to assuage her guilt by befriending her tenant and the woman's granddaughters, but her overtures lead to unexpected consequences.   \n",

       "3                                         Following the closing arguments in a murder trial, the 12 members of the jury must deliberate, with a guilty verdict meaning death for the accused, an inner-city teen. As the dozen men try to reach a unanimous decision while sequestered in a room, one juror (Henry Fonda) casts considerable doubt on elements of the case. Personal issues soon rise to the surface, and conflict threatens to derail the delicate process that will decide one boy's fate.   \n",

Aronnax (Paul Lukas) and his assistant Conseil (Peter Lorre), stranded in San Francisco by reports of a giant sea monster attacking ships in the Pacific Ocean, are invited to join an expedition to search for the creature. During the search, they and harpooner Ned Land (Kirk Douglas) are thrown overboard during an attack, eventually discovering that the supposed monster is actually a submarine piloted by the brilliant but haunted Captain Nemo (James Mason).   \n",
